# Logistic regression works like a detective trying to solve a mystery. It's used to figure out the chances of something happening.

The goal is to determine whether it’s 0 or 1 using two independent variables.given that the Age and Estimated
Salary determine an outcome such as when the person purchased or not, how can we successfully create a model that shows their relationships and use that for prediction? Here our two variables are Age and Estimated Salary. Each data point is then
classified either as 0 (didn’t buy) or 1 (bought).
