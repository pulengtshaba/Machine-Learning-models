# Random Forest Regression

It's good to use when there’s not much linearity between an independent variable and a target. However, this approach uses the dataset once to come up with results. 

It’s always good to get different results from different approaches (e.g. many decision trees) and then averaging those results.

## Just the same as Decision Tree, but with more different trees
