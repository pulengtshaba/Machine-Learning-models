# Decision Tree Regression

If thereâ€™s no linearity (but the dependent variables can still be used to predict the target)? Decision Tree Regression works by breaking down the dataset into smaller and smaller subsets.

## Requirements

1. Usually 2 or more features(inputs)
2. Continuous target(Output)
3. Non Linear relationship between variables(could be exponential or hyperbolic).
