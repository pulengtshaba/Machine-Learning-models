# Unsupervised algorithms

There were no correct answers or labels given. There’s only input data but there’s no output.There’s no supervision when learning from data. We just have a dataset and our goal is to see the groupings that have organically formed.

The goal is to look for structures in the data. In other words, we’re “dividing” the dataset into groups wherein members have some similarities or proximities. For example, each ecommerce
customer might belong to a particular group (e.g. given their income and spending level).

But once we apply a Clustering algorithm, the data will somehow make sense because we’ll be able to easily visualize the groups or clusters. Aside from discovering the natural
groupings, Clustering algorithms may also reveal outliers for Anomaly Detection.

Clustering is being applied regularly in the fields of marketing, biology, earthquake studies, manufacturing, sensor outputs, product categorization, and other scientific and business areas.

There are no rules set in stone when it comes to determining the number of clusters and which data point should belong to a certain cluster. It’s up to our objective (or if the results are useful enough). This is also where our expertise in a particular domain comes in.
